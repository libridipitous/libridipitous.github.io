        What's with the funny name? Why not call it &ldquo;Libri+Dipitous: a Blog&rdquo;?. Well, basically, the answer is because I want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Short story long, left to my own devices (and if the domain had been available) I would probably have named my whole site this. Why? Because I thought it was cute, that's why. But, not wanting to give anyone the idea that my portfolio might simply be filled with any sort of fluff <i>or</i> nonsense, I decided it wouldn't do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the name lives on here, where some of what I write most certainly qualifies as fluff and/or nonsense.
