During the summer between the first and second years of my MLIS program, I completed a directed fieldwork (a specifically structured internship) at the University of Washington's Botanic Gardens. Working jointly with the Information Technology Librarian at the Elisabeth Miller Horticultural Library and the Registrar of the Plant Records Office,  I took part in an ongoing living collection inventory, mapping, and records maintenance process. I worked both in the field at the Washington Park Arboretum and among the records at the Center for Urban Horticulture.

## Objectives

In order to guide my directed fieldwork experience, the IT Librarian and I formulated a set of learning objectives to be completed over the course of the summer:

* Verify the accuracy of plant locations on Arboretum maps with locations of plants in the field, aka "field check" existing Arboretum grid maps.
* Identify and fix discrepancies in BG-Base (the arboretum's database in which their collection is indexed) and map data.
* Enter data from relevant accession cards to enrich existing BG-Base records, ensuring that this data accurately represents the history of the plant.
* Update the Grid Inventory Process manual as some of the processes and goals of the Grid Inventory Process have changed in response to a recent focus on digitization.

## Inventory Workflow

Over the course of my DFW, I conducted the inventory process on four different "grids" within the Arboretum with the assistance of the Arboretum's Registrar. Grids are 100x100 square foot areas which were designated and mapped by the Arboretum in the late 1980s. They are used to precisely indicate the location of a given plant, and are given numbers based on their distance from a baseline.

When conducting inventory on a given grid, a copy of the most up-to-date map of that grid is taken into the field to compare the plants represented on the map to the plants actually present on the ground. That map gives not only the names and locations of each plant, but also the unique accession number which was given to that plant when it was originally received by the arboretum. The accession number contains the year a plant was acquired, which is often an invaluable piece of information when conducting the inventory process.

Although I followed the same basic process for each grid, there were a few particularly complicated cases I encountered, one of which I've chronicled here relating to a number of Rhododendrons of the 'Azor' cultivar with the accession number 2351-38 (meaning they were the 2,351st accession in 1938) which I encountered in grid 14-6E.

Resolving discrepancies like the one I describe here were the most rewarding part of this experience for me. I could see quite vividly how difficult the records were to interpret prior to this work, and how much easier they were to use after I was done.

Grid 14-6E had not been inventoried in some time; many of the plants were missing the labels necessary to identify them and a few were impossible to find as they had been buried by native plants. The Rhododendron 'Azor' plants, however, suffered from a more complex problem: not only were there some plants without their labels where we expected to find them based on the grid map, there were other plants which were not on the map which were labeled with that name and accession number.

To further complicate the matter, another Rhododendron 'Azor' plant with a different accession number (2415-37) had also been planted in grid 14-6E. So, the unlabeled plants could potentially have originally belonged to either accession number. And given that they had been received only one year apart, they were visually very similar. This is what the map looked like after we finished that field check (the 'Azor' plants are in the red box):

After finding this discrepancy, I knew I was going to need to examine the Arboretum's records on these plants to begin to sort it out. Prior to the adoption of BG-Base (a database tailored specifically to the needs of botanical gardens) in the late 1990s, all records of plantings and plant conditions were kept on 5"x7" cards.

The card for a given plant generally contains the plant's name and accession number along with all other information about that plant since it was planted. Cards can contain relatively minimal information (especially if there is only one plant belonging to a given accession number) or can be jam packed with a mixture of hand written and typed information, especially if many pants of that accession number have been planted over the years, as is often the case.

In the case of the Rhododendron 'Azor' plants in this grid, the cards for both accession numbers were quite packed. One interesting piece of information on them was that each accession number originally applied to quite a few plants. Thirty-nine plants were originally given the accession number 2351-38, and another fifteen plants were given the accession number 2415-37! Below are the two cards side by side:

</div>

Because the unlabeled plants could feasibly belong to either accession number, I needed to find more information about when and where they were planted in the hopes that there might be some reference that I could connect to the plants I was looking at. Luckily, the Records Office of the Washington Park Arboretum holds a wide variety of records including accession ledgers (used to record plants as they were acquired by the arboretum), old versions of the grid maps, and the original planting records created by the horticultural staff.

In the case of the 'Azor' plants, however, I could find no original planting records. The Registrar informed me that this was not uncommon for plants acquired and planted that long ago. At that time, large plantings would often be conducted in a few days without any records to document them.

Because grid 14-6E is part of a heavily-curated area in the Arboretum known as the "Rhododendron Glen", however, there are other records relating to plants in that area. I was able to find a couple of projects that had been done documenting those plants in the last few decades. Unfortunately, they only served to confirm what we already knew about the plants: that they had been found by the crew that created the grid maps in the late 1980s.

In spite of the general lack of information we had to go on, the Registrar and I had to make some decisions about how to label and identify these plants going forward. The card for accession 2351-38 had a note that seven plants labeled with that accession number had been found in grid 14-6E by a knowledgeable member of the Arboretum's staff in 1973, and as we had found six plants which could belong to that accession number during our field check and knew from BG-base that one had been removed in 1997, we decided we could reasonably conclude that the six 'Azor' plants in question belonged to accession number 2351-38.

Having come to that conclusion, the next step was to update the records in BG-base to accurately represent the plants in the field. Up until this point, all six 'Azor' plants had been represented by two numbers: 2351-38-A and 2351-38-B. The "-A" and "-B" are vitally important, as they are the only way the staff of the Arboretum can identify a specific plant from an accession number that belongs to multiple plants. After completing this process, each plant had a record that looked similar to the one below:

<div class="imageFrame">

</div>

Going forward, the horticultural and records staff will be able to record field checks that apply to a specific plant. So, if 2351-38-C, for instance, were to have particularly abundant flowers next year, it would be very easy for a staff member or volunteer to record the exceptional condition of that plant, thus enriching the quality of records the Arboretum maintains.

## Final Deliverable

After becoming quite familiar with the grid inventory process over the course of my DFW, my final deliverable was an updated version of the manual used to train new volunteers and staff at the Arboretum on how to conduct a grid inventory.

When I was first given the manual to begin to familiarize myself with the inventory process, I noticed that several of the procedures it detailed didn't match up with how the Registrar had described the process to me. As I began to conduct grid inventories myself, more and more discrepancies arose. After discussing this with the Registrar, it was decided that it was time for an update to be done, and that I would be in a good position to do it.

</div>

In addition to simply updating the procedures detailed by the manual, I identified a number of other stylistic and organization issues with the current version of the manual. Often, procedures were described in an unnecessarily complex fashion and "how" to do a procedure was frequently conflated with "why" it needed to be done.

In the updated version, I not only simplified and streamlined expalnations of various processes and procedures, but also reorganized how they were presented to present a more cohesive view of the process. I also designed and added a quick reference sheet meant to be taken out into the field. The Quick Sheet contains reference information that is vital to the inventory process, thus reducing the amount of information a new volunteer or staff member must memorize prior to conducting a field check.
