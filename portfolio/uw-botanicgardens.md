During the summer between the first and second years of my MLIS program, I completed a directed fieldwork (a specifically structured internship) at the University of Washington's Botanic Gardens. Working jointly with the Information Technology Librarian at the Elisabeth Miller Horticultural Library and the Registrar of the Plant Records Office,  I took part in an ongoing living collection inventory, mapping, and records maintenance process. I worked both in the field at the Washington Park Arboretum and among the records at the Center for Urban Horticulture.

## Objectives

In order to guide my directed fieldwork experience, the IT Librarian and I formulated a set of learning objectives to be completed over the course of the summer:

* Verify the accuracy of plant locations on Arboretum maps with locations of plants in the field, aka "ground truth" existing Arboretum grid maps.
* Identify and fix discrepancies in BGBase (the arboretum's database in which their collection is indexed) and map data.
* Enter data from relevant accession cards to enrich existing BGBase records, ensuring that this data accurately represents the history of the plant.
* Update the Grid Inventory Process manual as some of the processes and goals of the Grid Inventory Process have changed in response to a recent focus on digitization.
