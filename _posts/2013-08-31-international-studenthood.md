In the week since my arrival in Copenhagen, many things have required a bit of extra effort on my part to get used to. This, I'm sure, is only to be expected in a new city and country. Happily, I can announce that I have made _some_ headway towards being a functional city dweller.

I now no longer get (ridiculously) lost in the two mile radius around my hostel. I can take the same bike route to and from the campus where classes are held with a healthy degree of regularity. I have successfully located and patronized several grocery stores and pharmacies. I have even found one truly excellent coffee shop - the true measure of success for a caffeine-addict who has become spoiled by easy access to good coffee.

Na&iuml;ve as this sounds, I must admit that the thing that I am having the hardest time adjusting to is referring to and identifying myself as an "international student". It's not as if it's any big deal these days, right? I mean, _loads_ of people must spend good portions of their academic careers as international students. According to the Daily, we had a [12% increase in international applicants][daily-article] at UW this year.

It's just that I've never been one of them.

To be perfectly honest, I've never really taken the time before to understand what that is like for the international students I've encountered in my time at the University of Washington and elsewhere. They've always seemed to get on well enough - they showed up for class just like everyone else, did the readings, did the homework, did the groupwork, and appeared to have their own groups of friends just like everyone else.

But, for me anyway, there is a subtle weirdness that seems to come with being an international student. It's not that I haven't been made to feel welcome, because I have been almost overwhelmed by the enthusiasm with which our little group has been greeted. And it's subtly different from being a freshman or transfer student at a new institution.

Perhaps it's not simply that I'm experiencing a new institution, it's that I'm experiencing a new institution in a way that is fundamentally different from the way other new students experience that institution. I'm not sure how precisely I can articulate these differences, so I guess I'll have to settle for the low hanging fruits.

For starters, I know that this is by definition a transient experience. And perhaps this is somewhat unique to my four-week program of study, but it's difficult for me to feel a strong sense of studenthood at RSLIS when I know I'm not even going to be a student there for four months. I'm a UW Seattle student, who happens to be physically in Copenhagen at the moment instead of physically in Seattle, where I would normally be.

And perhaps because of that difficulty, I'm not really sure what's expected of me. Should an international student act differently? Should I go to the same parties as the other students, provided I can figure out where they are? And if I choose not to, am I somehow not fulfilling my obligation as an international student to reach out to the more permanent members of the community that has been gracious enough to allow me to be here?

And really, should I even be calling myself an international student? I must admit, my group probably isn't dealing with a tenth of the issues a longer-term international student must deal with. There are no Visas for me to wrangle, practically no language barrier to overcome, and (in reality) very few practical hoops to jump through because of the nature of the program I'm participating in.

As I get ready to commit this little blog post unto the wilds of the internet, I realize that I am likely the millionth person to think these things. But if I am going to honestly reflect on my experience thus far, this is what has dominated it this week.

So, please allow me to savor this moment of na&iuml;vet&eacute;. This is what studying abroad is all about, right?
