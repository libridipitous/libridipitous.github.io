At this point in my academic career, it is beginning to seem less and less likely that I will work in a place that calls itself a library. It’s a bittersweet realization on one hand, because libraries are wonderful places, yet encouraging on the other because I can finally tell people what I hope to be doing with myself in just under a year with some degree of confidence.

This is not to say, however, that I did not thoroughly enjoy the seven library tours we have been treated to over the course of this trip. It’s just that I had no clear ideas going into them about what I might take away from the experience, at least in terms of ideas that might be directly applicable to my likelier career paths. Thus unburdened by any self-imposed expectations of what I _should_ be getting out of the tours, I happily went along with the group on our seven library tours, expecting to enjoy them nonetheless.

Quite early on, I found myself noticing a theme in the way the librarians leading our tours were talking about their work and the larger workings of their libraries. Time and time again, I noticed the librarians introducing the programs or classes their libraries offered by saying “we thought our users might like ‘X’, so we gave it a try” or “our students said they would like us to have ‘X’, so we did it”. In other cases, they would say “we tried ‘X’, but nobody used it. So, that didn’t work so well!” and “you don’t really know what is going to work until you try.”

And they told us about a lot of things that they tried, some of which apparently worked out well enough for them to be around for me to shamelessly photograph them.

It struck me that this was not a way I could recall many other professionals of any stripe describing their work; they seemed to me to be as willing to discuss their failures and (perhaps more importantly) their willingness to fail as they were their successes. And these accounts were intermingled with one another in their presentations, not broken down into “these things that worked’ and “these things that didn’t”.

I feel the need to take a moment here to make it clear that I am not saying that I’ve _never_ heard such discussions before. And, as I haven’t talked with a ton of librarians at home about how they develop their library’s programs, I’m certainly not comparing Danish librarians’ views on the subject to those of American librarians. And maybe there are institutional or cultural factors I am not aware of that particularly foster this attitude towards failure. So while I acknowledge that there could well have been a lot going on behind the scenes that wasn’t discussed I’m just going to put all of that aside for the purposes of this post, because what I’d really like to do is examine the end results and what I took away how they were discussed.

So, what I found interesting (and hence worth reflecting upon) was that this perspective manifested itself in some way every discussion we had. This is a stark contrast compared to how I think when evaluating my own work, both in and out of school. Perhaps this is a common tendency, or perhaps is a bit more idiosyncratic, but I can’t honestly say that I give myself enough permission to fail in the way that it seemed these librarians were.

And what was truly remarkable about it was that what they produced was so cool! The little collage I made is just a fraction of the pictures I took on the various library tours. So it doesn’t seem too far-fetched to think that perhaps the fact that the librarians did not seem to really fear failure when they were crafting these things contributed to how original the results were.

It’s not as though this idea of being willing to make mistakes or accepting of failures was completely new to me, but I think seeing it pop up again and again in such an unexpected setting helped to me to better understand that it really could be done, and that some truly innovative ideas could develop as a result.
