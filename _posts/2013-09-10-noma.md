If you should ever expect to be in Copenhagen with two-hundred and fifty extra dollars, three months before you intend to be there you should make yourself a reservation at [Noma][noma-site]. Noma, a [two-star Michelin restaurant][michelin-system] has been hailed as one of (if not _the_) best restaurants in the world. Noma was founded by Claus Meyer and Ren&eacute; Redzepi as part of the [New Nordic Cuisine Movement][new-nordic-cuisine], one of the [primary focuses][new-nordic-manifesto] of which is to develop innovative ways to utilize ingredients native to the Nordic countries.

Three months before my own arrival in Copenhagen, I managed to get a reservation at Noma. I did not expect to have two-hundred and fifty extra dollars with me, but I managed to get a reservation on my birthday, so I resolved to live cheap the other twenty days I was in Copenhagen and booked the table for myself and five other adventurous souls anyway.&#42;

When we arrived at Noma, numerous staff members were waiting outside to greet us – by name. One woman (who ended up being our primary waitress) offered to take our picture before we went in; I suppose when you have been touted as one of the best restaurants in the world, you just assume people are going to want to make an event out of it. Another gentleman offered to take our bags and jackets before leading us to our impeccably set table and – quite literally – seating us in chairs (some of which were lined with fur pelts).

At this point, I’d like to say that this welcome was unlike anything I had ever experienced at a restaurant ever. And this is when I started to pay attention to more than just the fact that I was preparing to eat the most expensive meal I could imagine; I began to pay attention to what it was that I was experiencing beyond the food I was eating. And, perhaps due to my brain being saturated with instructional design theory, what I realized I was experiencing was not simply eating a meal, it was a carefully planned course (pun whole-heartedly intended) on how we were intended to experience the meal.

The particular nugget of learning theory with which my brain was saturated was John Keller’s [ARCS Model][what-is-arcs]. Keller explains his model as

> “…a problem solving approach to designing the motivational aspects of learning environments to stimulate and sustain students’ motivation to learn. There are two major parts to the model. The first is a [set of categories][arcs-categories] representing the components of motivation. … The second part of the model is a [systematic design process][arcs-design] that assists you in creating motivational enhancements that are appropriate for a given set of learners.”

The ARCS categories developed by Keller are **A**ttention, **R**elevance, **C**onfidence, and **S**atisfaction. As the meal progressed, it dawned on me that (regardless of whether this was their intent), the staff of Noma was engaging in a method of teaching us about the food they had prepared for us that closely mirrored this model.

I have already mentioned how my attention was first engaged: when we were greeted by name by the staff at the door. Once we were seated, however, the waitress (though I’m not at all sure that is the proper name for what she did) ensured that she did not lose our attention to the wonderful d&eacute;cor by explaining what the meal would be like.

The meal consisted of over twenty courses. It started with several snacks – small portions, often meant to be eaten in one or two bites. The snacks were followed by the main courses which, while I would certainly not describe them as large, were quite filling. Following the main courses we were served several desserts as well.

As each dish was presented to us, we were instructed by a member of Noma’s staff on its ingredients, preparation, and origin. This presentation helped me to understand the relevance of the dishes to the New Nordic Cuisine movement, though often it was also necessary to reassure us that we really were meant to eat the fantastic dish in front of us.

Following the presentation of each dish, the staff member did something truly wonderful: they explained _how_ we were to go about eating it. This helped to bolster my confidence by eliminating any concern on my part that I might not eat it “correctly”, thus revealing that I was ignorant of how to conduct myself at a restaurant of this caliber. At breakfast the morning after Noma, someone asked me whether I thought the atmosphere at Noma was pretentious and it struck me that Noma was perhaps the least pretentious place I had ever eaten; the manner in which were instructed on how to eat the food is largely responsible for this impression.

Upon reaching the end of this incredible meal, our sense of satisfaction at the accomplishment was reinforced by our waitress not only in the typical manner of asking us if we had enjoyed everything, but also by bringing us a special cake (on account of us being there to celebrate the birthdays of one of my fellow diners and I) which we were allowed to cut and plate on our own. Upon seeing our plating job, the waitress complimented us – even though it was really nowhere near up to Noma-standards.

As I reflect back on the experience I had at Noma a full week after it happened, I am still fascinated by how engrossing it was, and I’m incredibly thankful that I was fortunate enough to be visiting Copenhagen in such a way that I was able to afford the 1750 DKK bill.

&#42; At the time of this writing, I must report that my resolve has been severely weakened by how impossible it is to live cheaply in Copenhagen.
